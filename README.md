The project is largely based on source code from https://github.com/MakeMagazinDE/Preisrahmen, but uses the T5 4.7â€™ display from Lilygo (https://www.lilygo.cc/products/t5-4-7-inch-e-paper-v2-3), i.e. a combination of ESP32 and EPD (e-paper display).

The case I have used is from Thingiverse https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6167178

Compared to the original device based on the link above this solution has some advanctages (+) and disadvantages (-):
+ Easier, as you just buy the combined EPD with ESP and most probably cheaper for the same reason.
- Smaller display.
- No battery and most probably a much higher energy consumption as there is no optimisation in this regard.
